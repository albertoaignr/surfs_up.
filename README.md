# Surfs_up.

This analysis consist on writing a python script with the use of SQLite module to extract and represent insights on the weather in Oahu, Hawaii to make data-driven decision on the opening of an Ice Cream and Surf shop. 

## Results 

Writing queries, data was analized and the following statements can be made when applied the describe method:

- Counts +1,000 values for the temperature, this is a fair amount to validate and represent data collected. 
- Temperature averages for the months of June and December were: 74.94F and 71.04F, respectively.
- Similar standar deviation for the results meaning that temperature changes are close to the value represented in the average, which are not that far from one another. 
- Lower temperatures found on December compared to June, read in minimum temperature values.

## Summary 

From the data it's seen that temperatures in Oahu remain stable and consistent and somewhat warm during both months, it is a good indication that an Ice Cream shop will be a good idea. 

Additional queries that adds-on the analysis: 

- Precipitation for June
- Precipitation for December 

Information about precipitation is also helpful as it provides another point of view on the decision to make. Comparing both months, the results are that it's more likely to find more precipitation during the month of December which could affect any projection of sales. Being June the best opening opportunity.
